###### cut off distances
tmtm cut off = 4.0
rt cut off = 3.2
# rt shell = 2 # this only works for non-md-relaxed systems

###### exchange constants/factors
re tm exchange constant = 1e-21

tt factor = 0.65

###### cell tracking program
tracking = false

###### zr concentration (as a fraction)
zr concentration = 0

###### domain wall and pinned domain wall programs
domain wall = false
centre pin = false

###### domain wall parameters (nanometres)
# dw system dimension x = 12
# dw system dimension y = 3
# dw system dimension z = 3

###### to use this make sure material is e.g. smfeti12
ti concentration = 4
